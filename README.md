# Braille Web Navigator

Welcome to the **Braille Web Navigator**, an accessible web browsing engine designed to bridge the digital gap for the visually impaired. This project simulates a tactile operating system, converting live web content, search results, and even images into a readable Braille matrix.

While currently implemented as a web-based software simulation (HTML/Python), this architecture is designed to serve as the "brain" for a future physical tactile tablet device. The interface is designed to mimic a physical device with a 15x40 tactile pin matrix.

## ✨ Core Features

- **🔍 Live Web Search** Powered by DuckDuckGo and BeautifulSoup, the system scrapes the web and cleans up the UI, presenting only the essential text and navigable links.
- **📝 Text-to-Braille Engine** A custom Python backend (`traductor.PY`) translates alphanumeric characters into Spanish Braille patterns in real-time, handling special characters, numbers, and capitalization prefixes.
- **✋ Haptic Image Rendering** The system can process web images, resize them to a low-resolution grid (80x45), and convert them into binary Braille dot patterns, allowing users to "feel" images.
- **⌨️ Input Simulation** Includes a virtual Braille keyboard with three modes: Lowercase (abc), Uppercase (ABC), and Numeric (123), mimicking the input method of the physical device.
- **📄 Pagination & Navigation** Handles long web pages by splitting text into 40-character lines and managing page states (Next/Previous) automatically.

## 🛠️ Hardware Context

- **Important**: This repository represents the software stack. In the final implementation, the HTML interface (`index.html`) is intended to be replaced or mapped to a physical hardware controller (e.g., Raspberry Pi or ESP32) driving a grid of piezoelectric actuators or solenoids.


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository** Download the project files to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies** You will need Python installed on your machine. Install the following Python libraries (based on imports in `traductor.PY`):
   ```bash
   pip install flask duckduckgo-search requests beautifulsoup4 pillow
   ```

3. **Run the Server** Execute the main Python script to start the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   python traductor.PY
   ```

4. **Access the Interface** Open your web browser and navigate to the local address:
   - **URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

   You can now type into the virtual keyboard to search the web. Try commands like simple text searches or pasting a URL.

## 📂 Project Structure

* **traductor.PY**: The core backend. Handles the Flask server, Braille translation dictionary, web scraping logic, and image processing.
* **templates/index.html**: The frontend simulation. Renders the grid visually using CSS and handles user clicks to simulate touching a physical device.
* **Translation.jpeg**: Reference chart for the Spanish Braille system used in the project.


## 📜 License

This project is open source. Feel free to modify the code to adapt it to different Braille standards or hardware configurations.
